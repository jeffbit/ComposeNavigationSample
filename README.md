<h1 align = center>Jetpack Compose Navigation Sample </h1>
<p>This is a sample app  to demonstrate bottom bar navigation using Jetpack compose.</p>
<p>Navigation for Compose allows you to take advantage of navigating different composables using a NavHost.Each NavController must be associated with a single NavHost composable. The NavHost composable creates a navigation graph that specifies which composable to navigate to based on a String called "route", which defines the path or "route" to your composable. <p>
